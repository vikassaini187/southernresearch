            <h5>Southern Research "Sources"</h5>
            <div class="inner-p">
              <p>One of the best ways employees can assist Public Relations in generating media coverage is to serve as "sources" on topics that reporters are covering. This is especially important when there is national news breaking on a topic on which we have significant expertise, such as the NASA space program and emerging infectious diseases. Having a list of "sources" enables the PR Manager to make a quick connection between a reporter in search of a source, and scientists and engineers who can represent Southern Research in the matter.<br>

                To become a member of the Southern Research Sourcebook, please complete the Source Form, and submit it to the PR Manager by email. Marsha Hatfield </p>
